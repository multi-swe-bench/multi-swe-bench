**Contribution Incentive Plan for Multi-SWE-RL Community**

### **1. Introduction**  
The Multi-SWE-RL Community is an open-source initiative focused on collaborative dataset creation for software engineering and reinforcement learning research. To foster active participation and recognize contributors, we introduce this Contribution Incentive Plan. By contributing high-quality data, you directly support advancements in AI research and earn recognition within the community.

### **2. Incentive Tiers**

### **3. Contribution Guidelines**  
We have created a very [detailed demo](/demo.md) for this section.
