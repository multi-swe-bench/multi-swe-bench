We are extremely delighted to release **Multi-SWE-Bench** and **Multi-SWE-RL**.Multi-SWE-Bench aims to build a multi-language benchmark dataset containing real software engineering scenarios for evaluating the ability of LLM to solve real software engineering problems. The dataset supports multiple languages, currently including C, C++, Java, Javascript, Typescript, Rust, Go.

Among other things, our team has also created a **Multi-SWE RL community** to encourage people to make more real software engineering datasets and then contribute to the community to accelerate the research of LLM in software engineering. If you are interested in this, try to follow the following to make a dataset with your hands!

Welcome to join our community and stay tuned!

# Multi-SWE-RL Community
The Multi-SWE-RL Community is an open-source initiative focused on collaborative dataset creation for software engineering and reinforcement learning research. To foster active participation and recognize contributors, we introduce this Contribution Incentive Plan. By contributing high-quality data, you directly support advancements in AI research and earn recognition within the community.  

We offer different levels of incentives for contributors, such as being added to the [community contributor list](doc/contributors.md) or being named as an author of a technical report, etc. Please check out our [contribution incentive plan](doc/contribution-incentive-plan.md).

If you want to learn how to get involved in the Multi-SWE-RL community, from building data to submitting PRs, check out this detailedüëâ[Demo](doc/demo.md) or [quick-start](doc/build-dataset-quick-start.md)!
